3. Which of the following are accurate statements about git vs. Github?
- git is a free open-source project, while Github is a freemium service provided by a technology company
- You can use git without Github.
- git is a command line tool, while Github is a cloud service
- You can simultaneously use Github and other hosts like Bitbucket or Google Code for your git repositories, due to git's distributed version control model
4. Which statements are generally true about IAAS?
- An IAAS service allows you to provision, tear down, and set up new virtual machines programmaticall
- An IAAS service provides command line and/or root access to its machines.
5. Which statements are generally true about PAAS?
- A PAAS service usually stipulates conventions for how your source code should be laid out to facilitate deployment
- A PAAS service usually provides a blackbox deployment API that "just works" to get your site on the web, without giving much access to internal details
- A PAAS service asks the end user to do less configuration than a IAAS service, at the expense of less flexibility
6. What are true statements about Linux and Unix?
- Linux is a feat of reverse engineering of AT&T's proprietary Unix OS, compliant with the POSIX standard

- Linux shares no direct code with Unix (as established definitively by the SCO Lawsuit)
- The Android OS is based on Linux
7. Which are valid reasons for AWS to use virtual machines for EC2 rather than give direct access to physical servers?
- VMs can allow partitioning of the same underlying 8-CPU hardware into 1, 2, 4, 8, or possibly more separate instances, thereby increasing utilization

- A word processor is primarily intended to produce documents which are read by humans, while a text editor is capable of producing documents that are read by machines
- A word processor will not show you the raw characters which you are editing, but these can be important for computer programming
11. Why do we include "staging" in the dev/staging/production flow?
Because the dev environment is not exactly the same as the production environment, while staging is
12. Which of these are disadvantages of editing code directly on a live server, and using the deployment server as the sole source code repository?
- Contention if multiple engineers try to edit the site at the same time
- Inability to do A/B testing
- Inability to rollback buggy features
- Lack of source code backups
